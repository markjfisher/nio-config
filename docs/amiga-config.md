# config-nio for the Amiga Workbench

`config-nio` for the Amiga is a Workbench program. It configures FujiNet NIO
hosts, the disk images you mount, the `DN0:`–`DN7:` drives and the FujiNet's
Wi-Fi network. It runs on
Kickstart/Workbench 1.3 and later, in one window on the Workbench screen.

## Feature map

| BBC / MS-DOS config | Amiga |
| --- | --- |
| Hosts: add, edit, delete, move, browse | **Hosts** page: list, `URI` field; Browse / Add / Replace / Remove / Move Up / Move Down |
| Browse a host, enter directories, assign a file to a slot, map it to a drive | **Browse** page: name, size (or `Drawer`) and date; Open / Parent / Refresh / **Mount…** / **Add to Slot**. Mount lists the drives and what each holds; pick one, keep or untick `RO`, and press Mount (or Replace) |
| Slots: page through 0–255, edit, clear | **Catalogue** page: the occupied slots that FMOUNT mounts from; Mount… / Set / Clear |
| Drive map and "Mount + Exit" | **Drives** page: drive, mode, slot and image; Eject runs `FUMOUNT drive` |
| Preferences | **Settings** menu: date `YY-MM-DD`/`YY-DD-MM`, sizes Full/Compact |
| Wi-Fi / adapter info | **Settings ▸ Configure** opens the **Configuration** window: **Device** tab (firmware version, build profile) and **Network** tab (link state, SSID, signal, access point, IP, subnet, gateway, DNS, MAC); Refresh / **Join…** (scan, pick, passphrase) / Close |

The pages use the same model as the Shell commands, so the two can be used
side by side:

| Window | Shell |
| --- | --- |
| Mount… (Browse) | `FIN` into a slot (the one already holding the image, else the first empty one), then `FMOUNT slot drive RO\|RW` |
| Add to Slot (Browse) | `FIN slot image`; pick the slot from the list of all 256 |
| Catalogue page | `FLS` |
| Catalogue ▸ Set / Clear / Mount… | `FIN slot image` / `FOUT slot` / `FMOUNT slot drive` |
| Drives page | `FDRIVE` |
| Eject | `FUMOUNT drive` (the image stays in its slot) |
| Configuration window / Join… | Wi-Fi service (`0xF3`) `GET_STATUS`, `GET_CONFIG`, `GET_ADAPTER_INFO`, `SCAN`, `SET_CONFIG` |

Every change is saved to the FujiNet as soon as you make it. For that
reason the window has no Save/Use/Cancel buttons.

## Starting it

From a Shell:

```text
config-nio [FMOUNT=path] [FUMOUNT=path] [SCRIPT=file] [RESULT=file]
```

From Workbench, double-click the `config-nio` icon. Its ToolTypes use the same
`KEY=value` form. Unknown ToolTypes are ignored, and so are ToolTypes in
brackets, such as `(FMOUNT=...)`.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FMOUNT` | `fmount` | Command used by Mount, resolved through the inherited AmigaDOS command path |
| `FUMOUNT` | `fumount` | Command used by Eject, resolved through the inherited AmigaDOS command path |
| `SCRIPT` | none | Run commands from a file instead of waiting for input |
| `RESULT` | `RAM:config-nio.result` | Transcript file for `SCRIPT` |

Explicit `FMOUNT=` and `FUMOUNT=` command paths must not contain spaces.

Mount and Eject need `fmount`/`fumount` on the command path inherited by
config-nio, plus the resident `fujinet-disk.device`. An installer may put the
tools in `SYS:C`; a package-based setup can instead add its directory (such as
`NIO:`) to the command path. Set the `FMOUNT=` or `FUMOUNT=` ToolType only to
override that normal lookup with a specific command path. On a fresh system,
install the resident device, for example from the `NIO:` package share:

```text
Copy NIO:fujinet-disk.device DEVS:
NIO:fujinet-load-resident DEVS:fujinet-disk.device fujinet-disk.device
```

If a command fails, its last output line is shown in the status bar, for
example `FMOUNT failed for DN0: fmount: Unknown command (rc 10)`.

## Using the window

- Click a page button (Hosts / Browse / Catalogue / Drives), or press Tab /
  Shift-Tab, to change page.
- Click a row to select it. Double-click it, or press Return, to run the
  page's main action: browse a host, open a drawer, mount an image file,
  mount a catalogue slot, or open (or remount) a drive.

To mount an image:

1. On **Hosts**, double-click a host.
2. On **Browse**, open drawers until you find the image, then double-click
   it (or select it and press **Mount…**).
3. The list shows the drives and what is in each. The first empty drive is
   selected and `RO` is ticked. Pick a drive, untick `RO` for read/write if
   you need it, and press **Mount**. If the drive already holds a disk the
   button reads **Replace** and asks first. **Cancel** or Esc goes back.

To put an image in the catalogue without mounting it, select it on
**Browse** and press **Add to Slot**. The list then shows all 256 slots
with what each holds, the cursor on the slot that already holds the image,
otherwise the first empty one, and `RO` ticked. Move to the slot you want
and press **Add** (or double-click, or Return); **Cancel** or Esc goes
back. Typing a number jumps to that slot: `2` then `3` goes to slot 23, and
after a 2 second pause the next digit starts a new number. On a slot that holds a different image the button reads **Replace**
and asks first.

When mounting, config-nio puts the image in a catalogue slot for you, as `FIN` would. It
reuses the slot that already holds that image, otherwise the first empty
one, and the status line names the slot. The **Catalogue** page lists the
occupied slots (read a page at a time with range requests), so images you
mounted before can be mounted again from there. When all 256 slots are used,
Mount reports that the catalogue is full; clear some slots on the Catalogue
page.

- The cursor keys move the selection. With Shift they move a page at a time;
  with Alt they jump to the top or bottom. Backspace, or double-clicking the
  `..` row at the top of a drawer's listing, goes to the parent drawer. Help shows About. Esc quits.
- Remove, Clear, Eject and Replace ask for confirmation first.
- **Project** menu: About… (Right-Amiga-?), Quit (Right-Amiga-Q).
- **Settings** menu: date and size formats, and **Configure** (the
  Configuration window below).

## Configuration

**Settings ▸ Configure** opens the **Configuration** window over the main
window, which waits until it closes. It is read from the FujiNet when it
opens, and again with **Refresh** (or Return). It has two tabs (Tab switches
between them) and a **Close** button on every tab; Esc or the close gadget
also close it. **Help** shows the built-in **Configuration** help topic in
the window's list; **Back** (or Esc) returns. The main window's **Project**,
**Settings** and **Help** menus work in this window too: Quit quits
config-nio, Settings changes apply at once, and Help topics (and Contents)
open in this window.

The **Device** tab shows the FujiNet's **Firmware** version and build
**Profile** (e.g. `S3 + FujiBus over GPIO (e.g. RS232)`). The **Network** tab
shows:

| Row | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| Wi-Fi | Connected, Connecting, Disconnected, Failed to connect, or Off |
| Network | The saved SSID |
| Signal | A 4-bar icon and Excellent/Good/Fair/Weak (when connected): 4 bars from −55 dBm, 3 from −67, 2 from −75, 1 from −85. `SCRIPT` output keeps the dBm reading |
| Access point | BSSID of the access point in use |
| IP address, Subnet mask, Gateway, DNS server | IPv4 settings (when connected) |
| MAC address | The FujiNet's station MAC |
| Wi-Fi control | FujiNet (ESP32), Host computer, Simulated or Unavailable |

MAC address needs firmware with the Wi-Fi service's `GET_ADAPTER_INFO`
command, and Firmware and Profile need FujiDevice's `GetInfo`
(`fn_wifi_get_adapter_info()` and `fn_fuji_get_info()` in fujinet-nio-lib).
Each is read on its own: older firmware shows `Needs newer firmware` for what
it lacks, and the Device tab still works on a FujiNet without Wi-Fi.

To change network:

1. On the **Network** tab press **Join…**. The FujiNet scans, and the list
   becomes the network picker (**Join**, **Rescan**, **Other…**, **Cancel**,
   **Close**) showing each network's signal (bar icon and rating) and
   Open/Secured. The saved
   network, else the strongest, is selected. Hidden networks (no name) are
   not listed.
2. Select a network and press **Join** (or double-click, or Return). For a
   secured network a **Join Wi-Fi Network** window asks for the passphrase
   (8–64 characters); press **Join** or Return there, **Cancel** to go back.
   For the saved network, leave it empty to keep the stored passphrase. An
   open network needs no passphrase; joining one asks first when it replaces
   the current network.
3. For a hidden network press **Other…**: the window also has a
   **Network** field for its name. Return moves from Network to Passphrase.
   Leave the passphrase empty for an open network.
4. **Rescan** scans again; **Cancel** or Esc goes back to the Network tab.

Join saves the SSID and passphrase on the FujiNet (persisted), clears any
pinned BSSID, enables Wi-Fi and asks the FujiNet to reconnect. config-nio then
waits up to 10 seconds and reports `Connected to … address …`,
`Could not connect …` or `Still connecting …`. The passphrase is shown as you
type it, is wiped from memory once Join has sent it, and is never read back
from the FujiNet.

A FujiNet whose Wi-Fi is managed by its host computer (POSIX host mode) can
be viewed but not switched.

## Drives, FMOUNT and FMOUNTRESTORE

Mount and Eject run the standard `FMOUNT` and `FUMOUNT` commands. The
resident `fujinet-disk.device` stores successful mappings, so
`FMOUNTRESTORE` brings them back in a later session. After each command,
config-nio re-reads the stored mapping to decide whether it succeeded. On
Kickstart 1.3 this is the only reliable check, because `Execute()` does not
report a command's return code.

On Workbench 1.3 the drive names are the eight static MountList endpoints:
`DN0: DN1: HN0: HN1: DO0: DO1: HO0: HO1:` (units 0–7).

## SCRIPT language

Each line holds one command. Blank lines, and lines that start with `;`, are
ignored. Each command writes `OK` or `ERR <status>` to the transcript, and the
file ends with `SCRIPT DONE ok=N err=M`. The program returns 0 when no command
failed, and 5 otherwise.

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `page hosts\|browse\|catalogue\|drives` | Show a page |
| `host add URI`, `host edit URI`, `host remove`, `host up`, `host down`, `host select N` | Host list |
| `browse`, `select NAME`, `enter`, `parent`, `assign [SLOT] ro\|rw` | Browse the selected host; `assign` without a slot is Add to Slot |
| `mount DRIVE ro\|rw` | Mount the selected image, as the Mount… button does |
| `slot set N URI ro\|rw`, `slot clear N` | Catalogue |
| `insert SLOT DRIVE ro\|rw`, `eject DRIVE` | Drives (`DRIVE` is a name like `DN0:`) |
| `wifi status` | Re-read the Configuration window's data and write `NET <label> <value>` per row (Network rows, then Firmware and Profile) |
| `wifi scan` | Open the Join picker; write `NETWORK N RSSI OPEN\|SECURED SSID` per listed network (hidden ones are left out) |
| `wifi connect N [PASSPHRASE]` | Join scanned network `N` (after `wifi scan`); the passphrase is the rest of the line, spaces included |
| `wifi join SSID [PASSPHRASE]` | Join any network by name, hidden ones included. Without a passphrase, the saved network keeps its stored one; another network is joined as open |
| `wifi cancel` | Leave the Join picker |
| `dump hosts\|entries\|drives\|catalogue\|network\|status`, `dump slot N` | Write state to the transcript (`dump catalogue` writes `SLOT N RO\|RW URI` per occupied slot; `dump network` re-reads and writes the `NET` rows) |
| `wait TICKS` | Pause (1/50 s) so the window can be inspected |
| `quit` | Stop |

## Developer notes

| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `amiga_ctl.c` | Controller over the portable `config_nio` state and store |
| `amiga_script.c` | `SCRIPT=` interpreter |
| `amiga_net.c` | Configuration window rows and the Wi-Fi Join flow over `fn_wifi_*` |
| `amiga_list.c`, `amiga_layout.c`, `amiga_theme.c`, `amiga_input.c`, `amiga_format.c`, `amiga_options.c`, `amiga_drives.c` | Pure helpers |
| `amiga_gui.c` | Intuition window, gadgets, menus and rendering (V33 API) |
| `amiga_main.c`, `amiga_exec.c`, `amiga_stack.c` | Process start-up, command execution, stack size |

Everything except the last two rows is tested on the host with gcc, against
an in-memory fake of the fujinet-nio calls:

```sh
make test-amiga-host              # all tests
make test-amiga-host ONLY=layout  # one test
```

Build one Workbench profile. `wb13` uses the nix13 CRT; `wb31` and `wb32`
use clib2.

```sh
make amiga AMIGA_PROFILE=wb32
make amiga AMIGA_PROFILE=wb13
```

The logo in the window and the icon both come from
`images/config-nio-160x96x4.png`. `amiga/tools/mklogo.py` resamples it for
hires pixels, which are about twice as tall as they are wide: 84x27 masks
in `src/platform/amiga/amiga_logo_data.c` and 96x30 icon art in
`amiga/gfx/config-nio.icon.txt`. The emblem is drawn in the fill pen and
the lettering in the text pen, so it suits both the 1.3 and the 2.x+
palettes. To regenerate both, and then the icon:

```sh
make regen-amiga-icons
```
