  "FujiNet Config lets you choose disk images on your FujiNet hosts and "
  "mount them as Amiga drives.\n"
  "\n"
  "1. On the Hosts page, double-click a host.\n"
  "2. On the Browse page, open drawers until you find the disk image, then "
  "double-click it.\n"
  "3. Choose a drive in the list. Read-only (RO) is ticked; untick it if "
  "you need to write to the disk. Press Mount.\n"
  "\n"
  "The disk appears on Workbench like any other disk. Every change is "
  "saved on the FujiNet at once, so there is nothing to save when you "
  "quit.",

  "The Hosts page lists the servers and devices FujiNet can browse, for "
  "example tnfs://fujinet.online or sd0:/ for the FujiNet's own SD card. "
  "Up to 8 hosts are kept.\n"
  "\n"
  "- Browse opens the selected host (double-click does the same).\n"
  "- Add adds the text in the URI field as a new host.\n"
  "- Replace changes the selected host to the text in the URI field.\n"
  "- Remove deletes the selected host after asking.\n"
  "- Move Up and Move Down change the order.\n"
  "\n"
  "A host without a scheme, such as fujinet.online, is treated as a TNFS "
  "server.",

  "The Browse page shows the drawers and files of the host you opened. "
  "Drawers are marked Drawer; files show their size and date.\n"
  "\n"
  "- Double-click a drawer, or press Open, to enter it.\n"
  "- Double-click .. (the first row inside a drawer), press Parent, or "
  "press Backspace to go up one level.\n"
  "- Refresh reads the listing again.\n"
  "- Double-click a disk image, or select it and press Mount..., to mount "
  "it.\n"
  "- Add to Slot puts the selected image in the catalogue without "
  "mounting it, like FIN. It lists all 256 slots with the cursor on the "
  "slot that already holds the image, else the first empty one. Move to "
  "the slot you want, tick or untick RO, and press Add (or double-click, "
  "or Return). Type a slot number to jump to it: 2 then 3 goes to slot "
  "23; after a 2 second pause a new number starts. On a slot holding "
  "another image the button reads Replace and asks first.\n"
  "\n"
  "Mount lists the drives and what each one holds. The first empty drive "
  "is selected and RO is ticked. Choose a drive and press Mount. If the "
  "drive already holds a disk the button reads Replace and asks first. "
  "Cancel or Esc goes back without mounting.\n"
  "\n"
  "Mount is the same as FIN then FMOUNT in the Shell: the image is put in "
  "a catalogue slot (the one already holding it, else the first empty "
  "one) and that slot is mounted on the drive. The message says which "
  "slot was used.\n"
  "\n"
  "Very large drawers show their first 200 entries.",

  "The Drives page shows every FujiNet drive with the image mounted in it, "
  "its catalogue slot and whether it is read-only (RO) or read/write (RW), "
  "as FDRIVE does in the Shell.\n"
  "\n"
  "- Double-click a drive holding a disk, or press Return, to open its "
  "window on Workbench, as double-clicking its disk icon does (Workbench "
  "3.5 or later).\n"
  "- Eject unmounts the selected drive after asking, like FUMOUNT. The "
  "image stays in the catalogue.\n"
  "\n"
  "On Workbench 2.0 and later the drives are DN0: to DN7:. On Workbench 1.3 "
  "they are DN0: and DN1: (double density, FFS), HN0: and HN1: (high "
  "density, FFS), DO0: and DO1: (double density, OFS) and HO0: and HO1: "
  "(high density, OFS).\n"
  "\n"
  "The FujiNet remembers which image is in each drive. After a reboot a "
  "drive shows (not mounted) until it is mounted again: double-click it "
  "or press Remount. The installer mounts them all again at every boot "
  "with FMOUNTRESTORE.",

  "The Catalogue page lists the FujiNet's numbered slots that hold a disk "
  "image, as FLS does in the Shell. FMOUNT mounts a slot by its number, "
  "and Mount fills slots for you, so the images you have mounted before "
  "are here to mount again without browsing.\n"
  "\n"
  "- Double-click a slot, or press Mount..., to mount it on a drive you "
  "choose (FMOUNT).\n"
  "- Selecting a slot copies it into the URI, Slot and RO fields.\n"
  "- Set stores the URI field in the slot number given (FIN).\n"
  "- Clear empties the selected slot after asking (FOUT). A drive that "
  "has the image mounted keeps it.\n"
  "\n"
  "There are 256 slots, 0 to 255. When all are used, Mount reports that "
  "the catalogue is full; clear some here.",

  "Settings > Configure opens the Configuration window. It is read from "
  "the FujiNet each time it opens, and the main window waits until you "
  "press Close (or Esc, or its close gadget).\n"
  "\n"
  "- The Device tab shows the FujiNet's firmware version and build "
  "profile.\n"
  "- The Network tab shows whether Wi-Fi is connected, the network (SSID) "
  "it uses, the signal, the access point, its IP address, subnet mask, "
  "gateway and DNS server, its MAC address and who controls the Wi-Fi.\n"
  "- Refresh (or Return) reads them again. Tab switches tabs. Help "
  "shows this topic in the window; Back returns.\n"
  "- The Project, Settings and Help menus work here too; Help topics "
  "open in this window.\n"
  "- Join... on the Network tab scans for networks and lists them with their signal and "
  "whether they are Open or Secured. The network in use, else the "
  "strongest, is selected.\n"
  "\n"
  "To change network, select it and press Join (or double-click it). For "
  "a secured network a window asks for the passphrase (8 to 64 "
  "characters); press Join or Return there. For the network already saved "
  "you can leave it empty to keep the stored passphrase. An open network "
  "needs none. Rescan scans again; Cancel or Esc goes back to the "
  "Network tab.\n"
  "\n"
  "Join saves the network on the FujiNet, which then reconnects; the "
  "status line says whether it connected. Until it does, hosts cannot be "
  "browsed. The passphrase is never read back from the FujiNet.\n"
  "\n"
  "Hidden networks are not listed. Press Other... and type the "
  "network's name and passphrase; leave the passphrase empty for an open "
  "network.\n"
  "\n"
  "MAC address, Firmware and Profile read \"Needs newer firmware\" when "
  "the FujiNet's firmware cannot report them.",

  "The Settings menu changes how the Browse page shows files. Settings "
  "are saved on the FujiNet at once.\n"
  "\n"
  "- Dates YY-MM-DD or YY-DD-MM chooses the date order.\n"
  "- Sizes Full shows exact byte counts; Sizes Compact shows Kb, Mb and "
  "Gb.\n"
  "- Configure opens the Configuration window: the FujiNet's firmware "
  "version, its network settings and Wi-Fi network (see the "
  "Configuration topic).\n"
  "\n"
  "Colours follow your Workbench palette.",

  "- Cursor Up and Down move the selection. With Shift they move a page; "
  "with Alt they go to the top or bottom.\n"
  "- Return, or a double-click, runs the page's main action.\n"
  "- Backspace goes to the parent drawer on the Browse page.\n"
  "- On the Add to Slot list, typing a number jumps to that slot.\n"
  "- Tab and Shift-Tab change page: Hosts, Browse, Catalogue, Drives.\n"
  "- Help opens this help. Esc closes help, cancels Mount, or quits.\n"
  "- Right-Amiga-? shows About and Right-Amiga-Q quits.",

  "from the NIO package in a Shell:\n"
  "\n"
  "  Execute NIO:Install-config-nio\n"
  "\n"
  "It copies the program to SYS:Tools, installs the FujiNet commands and "
  "devices if they are missing, and asks whether to add FujiNet Config to "
  "SYS:WBStartup. Use AUTO or NOAUTO to answer in advance, and REMOVE to "
  "stop it starting automatically.\n"
  "\n"
  "Workbench 1.3 has no WBStartup drawer; the ReadMe explains the one line "

  "- FUMOUNT=path is the eject command (default fumount via command path).\n"
  "- SCRIPT=file runs commands from a file instead of the window.\n"

  "loaded. Run the installer and reboot.\n"

  "the installer, or set the FMOUNT ToolType.\n"
  "- \"Cannot open fujinet-disk.device\": the disk device is not loaded. "
  "The installer adds it to S:User-Startup; reboot afterwards.\n"
  "- \"Browse failed\": the host could not be reached. Check the URI and "
  "the FujiNet's network in Settings > Configure.\n"
  "- \"Could not connect\" after Join: the passphrase is wrong or the "
  "network is out of range. Join again with the right passphrase.\n"
  "- \"FUMOUNT failed ... handler (busy)\": a program still uses the "
  "disk, for example an open drawer or a Shell whose current directory is "
  "on it. Close it and try again. The Workbench 3.1 filesystem cannot "
  "release a disk while it runs, so there the disk stays mounted until "
  "the next reboot.",

  "FujiNet Config for the Amiga, part of FujiNet NIO.\n"

  "commands to mount FujiNet disk images. Settings > Configure shows the "
  "FujiNet's firmware and changes its Wi-Fi network."
